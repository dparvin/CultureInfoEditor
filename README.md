# CultureInfoEditor
In Windows you have the ability to register custom cultures but I have not found a program that allows you to create and register them.  This project is to make a way of creating custom cultures to register, save and edit them and to register and unregister them.

After starting this project and working on it for a few hours, I found that Microsoft has written an editor for Locales.  See <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41158">Microsoft's Locale Builder 2.0</a>.
